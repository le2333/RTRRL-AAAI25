# Real-Time Recurrent Reinforcement Learning

Code Appendix for the Paper "[Real-Time Recurrent Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04830)" accepted for AAAI 2025.

## Install

1. Install [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)
2. Sync dependencies from the repository root:

```
uv sync
```

## Run

```
uv run python rtrrl.py
```

## Loggging

You can log results using [`aim`](https://aimstack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html), [`wandb`](https://wandb.ai/), or both at once. Aim runs locally on the jump host; W&B is cloud-hosted and also drives hyperparameter sweeps.

You can enable logging by providing the `--logging` argument: `aim`, `wandb`, or `aim+wandb` (dual logging — metrics go to both).

```
uv run python rtrrl.py --logging aim
uv run python rtrrl.py --logging aim+wandb   # dual logging
```

W&B needs an API key: `wandb login` locally, or set `WANDB_API_KEY` (on AWS Batch it is injected from Secrets Manager — see `infra/README.md`). For hyperparameter sweeps see the "Hyperparameter sweeps" section of `infra/README.md`.

For PPO runs, set `logging: "aim"` and `log_repo` in the YAML config. For
example, `config/ppo_hopper_default_2m.yml` writes to `logs/aim/.aim`.

To view Aim results when this project is running on a remote machine, start the
Aim UI from the repository root in the remote project terminal:

```
uv run aim up --repo logs/aim/.aim --host 0.0.0.0 --port 43800
```

Then forward remote port `43800` through Cursor/SSH and open the forwarded local
address in your browser, usually:

```
http://localhost:43800
```

If Cursor shows an "Open in Browser" prompt for the forwarded port, use that
link. Use Aim's run list, metric filters, or the run hash printed by your
tracking workflow to find a specific run.

## Running on AWS Batch

To run training at scale on AWS Batch (EC2-backed CPU compute) with metrics
streamed to Aim and/or W&B (and W&B-driven hyperparameter sweeps), see
[`infra/README.md`](infra/README.md). In
short, after the one-time setup you push to `main` (GitHub Actions builds and
pushes the image) and submit runs with:

```
infra/submit.sh --config config/rtrrl_brax_halfcheetah_paral1.yml --name my_run
```

Configs are injected at submit time (not baked into the image), so changing a
config needs no rebuild. **Note:** the pipeline pins `jax==0.5.0`; see the
caveats in `infra/README.md` before upgrading.

## CUDA support

A GPU can speed up training when using large batch sizes but will slow it down for smaller ones. 

The project pins JAX through its dependency graph. For JAX `0.5.0`, CUDA support
is provided by the plugin-based `jax[cuda12]` extra rather than a separate CUDA
`jaxlib` wheel. Install the CUDA 12 plugin into the uv environment with:

```
uv run poe install_jax_cuda12
```

Check the active backend and devices:

```
uv run python -c "import jax; print(jax.default_backend()); print(jax.devices())"
```

To force CPU execution even when a GPU backend is installed:

```
JAX_PLATFORM_NAME=cpu uv run python -c "import jax; print(jax.default_backend()); print(jax.devices())"
```

## Configurables
This is an incomplete table of configurables.
Run `uv run python rtrrl.py --help` to find out more.

There is a preset for `brax` environments that can be used by providing the config path:

```
uv run python rtrrl.py --config_path configs/brax.yml
```
