# RTRRL AWS infra

Pipeline to run RTRRL / PPO training on **AWS Batch** (EC2-backed, CPU, e.g.
`c7a.xlarge`), with metrics streamed live to **Aim** (on the jump host) and/or
**Weights & Biases**. This path is validated end-to-end (image build -> Batch
job -> training -> metrics). W&B also drives **hyperparameter sweeps** (see
"Hyperparameter sweeps" below).

**Not wired up yet (by choice):** S3 checkpoint sync and Aim run-resume across
Spot interruptions. Jobs run on on-demand EC2, so a run is not interrupted and
resume is unnecessary for now.

.github/workflows/build-image.yml   # builds + pushes the image on push to main
```

## How the image is built

Primary path is **GitHub Actions** (`.github/workflows/build-image.yml`): on a
push to `main` that touches `**.py`, `pyproject.toml`, `uv.lock`,
`infra/docker/**`, or the workflow itself, it assumes `rtrrl-github-actions-role`
via OIDC, creates the ECR repo if needed, builds the CPU image, and pushes
`rtrrl:cpu` and `rtrrl:<sha>`. Just push your changes; no local Docker needed.

`infra/build-and-push.sh` is only a manual fallback (needs Docker locally).

## One-time setup order

1. **IAM** — `infra/iam/setup-iam.sh` (creates `rtrrl-ecs-instance-role`,
   `rtrrl-batch-job-role`, `rtrrl-batch-execution-role`; control-plane perms
   live on the `controller` role).
2. **GitHub OIDC** — `infra/iam/setup-github-oidc.sh` (OIDC provider +
   `rtrrl-github-actions-role`, so Actions can push to ECR).
3. **(For W&B) Create the API-key secret** — once, with admin/console creds
   (keeps the key out of git and job overrides):
   ```bash
   aws secretsmanager create-secret --name rtrrl/wandb-api-key \
     --secret-string '<your-wandb-api-key>' --region eu-north-1
   ```
   Paste the returned **full ARN** into `WANDB_SECRET_ARN` in `infra/env.sh`.
   The execution role (`rtrrl-batch-execution-role`) already has read access.
4. **Edit `infra/env.sh`** — set `SUBNET_IDS`, `SECURITY_GROUP_ID`, `AIM_SERVER`
   (jump host private IP), `WANDB_SECRET_ARN` / `WANDB_PROJECT` / `WANDB_ENTITY`,
   default `LOGGING`, confirm `ECR_REPO`, `INSTANCE_TYPE`.
5. **Build image** — push to `main` and let GitHub Actions build it.
6. **Create Batch resources** — `infra/batch/create-batch.sh` (idempotent;
   re-registers the job definition each run). Re-run it after setting
   `WANDB_SECRET_ARN` so the job definition injects `WANDB_API_KEY`.
7. **(Optional) S3 bucket** — only needed once checkpointing is added:
   ```bash
   aws s3api create-bucket --bucket "$S3_BUCKET" --region eu-north-1 \
     --create-bucket-configuration LocationConstraint=eu-north-1
   ```

## Run training

1. **Start the Aim server on the jump host** (once; leave it running). It must be
   up *before* submitting, or metric logging from the job will fail:

   ```bash
   nohup uv run aim server --repo logs/aim/.aim --host 0.0.0.0 --port 53800 \
     > logs/aim-server.log 2>&1 &
   ```

2. **Submit runs** (one per config; loop for parallel runs). Each `--name`
   becomes its own run. Logging defaults to `$LOGGING` (`aim+wandb`); override
   with `--logging aim|wandb|aim+wandb`:

   ```bash
   # RTRRL (dual logging by default)
   infra/submit.sh --config config/rtrrl_brax_halfcheetah_paral1.yml --name hc_p1

   # PPO baseline, Aim only
   infra/submit.sh --entry ppo_baseline.py --logging aim \
     --config config/ppo_hopper_default_2m.yml --name ppo_hopper

   # Override params without a new config file (e.g. a seed sweep)
   for s in 1 2 3; do
     infra/submit.sh --config config/rtrrl_brax_halfcheetah_paral1.yml \
       --name hc_seed$s -- --seed $s
   done

   # Smoke test: a few episodes to validate the path quickly
   infra/submit.sh --config config/rtrrl_brax_halfcheetah_paral1.yml \
     --name smoke -- --episodes 30
   ```

3. **Watch a job**:

   ```bash
   aws batch describe-jobs --region eu-north-1 --jobs <jobId> \
     --query "jobs[0].{status:status,exit:container.exitCode,reason:container.reason,log:container.logStreamName}"

   # full container logs (CloudWatch)
   aws logs get-log-events --region eu-north-1 --log-group-name /aws/batch/job \
     --log-stream-name "<logStreamName>" --start-from-head \
     --query "events[].message" --output text
   ```

4. **View metrics in Aim** — on the jump host, start the UI and forward the port
   (see the repo root README "Logging" section):

   ```bash
   uv run aim up --repo logs/aim/.aim --host 0.0.0.0 --port 43800
   ```

   W&B runs appear at `https://wandb.ai/<entity>/RTRRL`.

## Hyperparameter sweeps (W&B)

W&B Sweeps drive HPO; agents run as Batch jobs and pull trials from the W&B
controller. The sweep maximizes `eval/best_eval_reward` for the PPO baseline.

Sweep parameters use **dotted keys** (e.g. `ppo_overrides.learning_rate`) so they
land in nested `PPOParams` fields. `logging_util.with_logger` reads
`wandb.config`, expands the dotted keys, and merges them into the dataclass
before training — so they reach `brax` `ppo.train()`. The sweep `command` has no
`${args}`, so params flow only through `wandb.config` (not the CLI).

```bash
# One-time on the jump host: authenticate W&B (key stored in ~/.netrc).
uv run wandb login

# 1) Create the sweep (edit infra/sweep.yaml to adjust ranges first).
infra/sweep.sh create
#    -> prints a sweep id like <entity>/RTRRL/abc123

# 2) Launch N parallel agents on Batch, each with a base config (env +
#    num_timesteps come from this config; the sweep overrides ppo_overrides.*).
infra/sweep.sh launch <entity>/RTRRL/abc123 4 \
  --config config/ppo_hopper_default_2m.yml --count 1
```

Each agent injects the base config (`CONFIG_B64` -> `/tmp/run-config.yml`) and
runs `wandb agent`, which executes `ppo_baseline.py` with the trial's params.
Increase `--count` to have one agent run several trials sequentially, or raise
the number of agents (and Batch `maxvCpus`) for more parallelism. Sweep runs log
to **W&B only** by default (the sweep lives there); add `aim` to the `command` in
`infra/sweep.yaml` if you also want them in the Aim repo.

## Caveats / gotchas

- **Do NOT upgrade JAX past 0.5.0.** `pyproject.toml` pins `jax==0.5.0` /
  `jaxlib==0.5.0` on purpose. JAX 0.6+ removed the `jax.jax` self-alias used by
  `envs/wrappers.py` (`jax.jax.tree.map`) and changed array types so `aim` 3.28
  can no longer track them. Re-running `uv lock` without the pin will silently
  re-break training. If you regenerate the lock, keep the pin.
- **The Aim server must be running on the jump host before you submit.** The job
  connects to `AIM_SERVER` (`aim://<jump-host-private-ip>:53800`) from
  `infra/env.sh`. If the jump host IP changes, update `AIM_SERVER`.
- **Compute environment scales to zero when idle** (`minvCpus=0`). The first job
  after idle waits ~1-2 min for an instance to launch; there is no cost while no
  job runs.
- **Configs are injected at submit time, not baked into the image.** `submit.sh`
  base64-encodes the chosen YAML into `CONFIG_B64`; the entrypoint decodes it to
  `/tmp/run-config.yml`. Editing or adding a config needs no image rebuild — just
  re-submit. (Configs are tiny YAML, so inlining beats S3.)
- **Builder needs a C++ toolchain.** `pytinyrenderer` (via `brax`) has no wheel
  and compiles from source, so the Dockerfile installs `build-essential` in the
  builder stage (stripped from the runtime image).
- **GitHub Actions build cache** requires the `docker-container` buildx driver
  (the workflow sets it up). The default docker driver cannot export `type=gha`.
- **W&B needs the API key in the container.** The job definition injects
  `WANDB_API_KEY` from Secrets Manager via the execution role
  (`rtrrl-batch-execution-role`). If `WANDB_SECRET_ARN` is empty, `create-batch.sh`
  registers the job def WITHOUT it — then `--logging wandb`/`aim+wandb` jobs fail.
  Set the ARN and re-run `create-batch.sh`. The key is never put in git or job
  overrides.

## Networking prerequisites

- The compute subnet must reach **ECR** and **S3**. Using a public subnet with
  auto-assigned public IPs (current setup) needs no NAT/VPC endpoints.
- The jump host security group must allow inbound TCP **53800** from the compute
  security group (Aim); the compute SG needs egress for ECR/S3 and to the jump
  host.
